In this guide, we’re going to run through the bare necessities to use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) for managing a Drupal 8 site on your local machine and pushing to Pantheon.

Using a Composer managed site **removes** the ability to [apply Drupal core updates via the site dashboard](https://pantheon.io/docs/core-updates/). This is for advanced users who are comfortable taking complete responsibility for the management of site updates with Composer.

## Creating the Pantheon Site

To begin, we’ll want to start a brand new Drupal 8 site on Pantheon from our empty upstream. This upstream is different from the Drupal 8 upstream in that it does not come with any Drupal files. As such, you must use Composer to download Drupal.

Before we begin choose a machine-friendly site name. It should be all lower case with dashes instead of spaces. I'll use `d8-composer-no-CI` but choose your own. Once you have a site name export it to a variable for re-use.

```
export PANTHEON_SITE_NAME="d8-composer-no-CI"
```

Create a new Pantheon site with an empty upstream.

```
terminus site:create $PANTHEON_SITE_NAME 'Andrew Drops 8 Composer' empty
```

**Note** you can also add the `--org` argument to `terminus site:create` if you would like the site to be part of an organization. See `terminus site:create -h` for details and help.

## Cloning example-drops-8-composer locally

Instead of setting up `composer.json` manually it is easier to start with the [`example-drops-8-composer`](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/example-drops-8-composer) repository.

First, clone the `example-drops-8-composer` repository locally.

```
git clone git@github.com:pantheon-systems/example-drops-8-composer.git $PANTHEON_SITE_NAME
```

Change into the cloned directory.

```
cd $PANTHEON_SITE_NAME
```

## Updating the git remote URL

Store the git URL for the Pantheon site created earlier in a variable.

```
export PANTHEON_SITE_GIT_URL="$(terminus connection:info $PANTHEON_SITE_NAME.dev --field=git_url)"
```

Update the git remote to use the Pantheon site git URL returned rather than the `example-drops-8-composer` GitHub URL.

```
git remote set-url origin $PANTHEON_SITE_GIT_URL
```

## Removing Automation Pieces
`example-drops-8-composer` was designed to run automated tests on a continuous integration server. Since contonuous integration won't be used you can safely remove the directories below.

* `scripts/github`
* `scripts/gitlab`
* `.circleci`

If you don't plan on running automated tests locally you can completely remove the testing functionality.

<div class="panel panel-drop panel-guide" id="accordion">
  <div class="panel-heading panel-drop-heading">
    <a class="accordion-toggle panel-drop-title collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" data-proofer-ignore data-target="#unique-anchor">
      <h3 class="info panel-title panel-drop-title" style="cursor:pointer;"><span style="line-height:.9" class="glyphicons glyphicons-wrench"></span>Remove Test Suites</h3>
    </a>
  </div>
  <div id="unique-anchor" class="collapse" markdown="1" style="padding:10px;">
    First, delete the `tests` directory. Next, you will need to modify `composer.json`.

    * Remove all dependencies in the `require-dev` section
    * Update the `scripts` section to the following:

    ```
        "scripts": {
            "build-assets": [
                "@prepare-for-pantheon",
                "composer install --optimize-autoloader --no-dev"
            ],
            "drupal-scaffold": "DrupalComposer\\DrupalScaffold\\Plugin::scaffold",
            "prepare-for-pantheon": "DrupalProject\\composer\\ScriptHandler::prepareForPantheon",
            "post-install-cmd": [
                "@drupal-scaffold",
                "DrupalProject\\composer\\ScriptHandler::createRequiredFiles"
            ],
            "post-update-cmd": [
                "DrupalProject\\composer\\ScriptHandler::createRequiredFiles"
            ],
            "post-create-project-cmd": [
                "@drupal-scaffold",
                "DrupalProject\\composer\\ScriptHandler::createRequiredFiles"
            ]
        },
    ```
  </div>
</div>

## Managing Drupal with Composer

### Downloading Drupal Dependencies with Composer

Normally the next step would be going through the standard Drupal installation. But since we’re using Composer, none of the core files exist yet. Let’s use Composer to download Drupal core.

Since we modified `composer.json` we will need to update Composer. This will also download the defined dependencies. 

```
composer update
```

This may take a while as all of Drupal core and its dependencies will be downloaded. Subsequent updates should take less time.

Let's take a look at the changes.

```
git status
```
It appears that our web directory isn't being committed. This is because the `example-drops-8-composer` `.gitignore` file assumes that you’re using a build step with continuous integration. To make it compatible with this manual method, you need to edit the `.gitignore` file and remove everything above the CUT section. 

**Important:** Without this modification critical components, such as Drupal core and contrib modules, will be ignored and not pushed to Pantheon. 

Now let’s run git status again to make sure everything is included.

```
git status
```

![image of git status showing the changed files in red](/source/docs/assets/images/guides/drupal-8-composer-no-ci/drops-8-composer-git-status-after-installing-d8.png)

Set the site to git mode.

```
terminus connection:set $PANTHEON_SITE_NAME.dev git
```

Add and commit the code files. A git force push is necessary because we are writing over the empty repository on Pantheon with our new history that was started on the local machine. Subsequent pushes after this initial one should not use `--force`.

```
git add .

git commit -m 'Drupal 8 and dependencies'

git push --force
```

**Note** the `vendor` directory is being committed to Pantheon. This is because Pantheon needs the full site artifact. If you prefer to ignore the `vendor` directory then take a look at [our build tools guide](https://pantheon.io/docs/guides/build-tools/) for documentation on the more advanced automated workflow with a build step.

### Installing Drupal

Now that the code for Drupal core exists on our Pantheon site, we need to actually install Drupal.

Use Terminus Drush to install Drupal.

```
terminus drush $PANTHEON_SITE_NAME.dev -- site-install -y
```

Log in to your new Drupal 8 site to verify it is working. You can get a one-time login link using Drush.

```
terminus drush $PANTHEON_SITE_NAME.dev -- uli
```

### Adding a New Module with Composer

Next, let’s add a new module to our site. For this example, we’ll add the address module. We advocate working in feature branches on Pantheon, so let's create a git branch and spin up a Multidev environment.

```
git checkout -b addr-module

composer require "drupal/address ~1.0"
```

Now that Composer is aware of our new module requirement we need to update our dependencies. Then, we can commit them and push to Pantheon.

```
composer update

git add .

git commit -m "Adding the address module with Composer"

git push -u origin addr-module
```

Spin up a Multidev environment from the git branch we just pushed up to Pantheon.

```
terminus multidev:create $PANTHEON_SITE_NAME.dev addr-module
```

Log in to your new environment and verify that the address module exists.

```
terminus drush $PANTHEON_SITE_NAME.addr-module -- uli
```

### Managing Drupal Updates with Composer
Just like adding a new module updates to existing Composer managed third-party items (Drupal core, contrib modules and themes) will need to be done locally.

You can run `composer update` to download all available updates within the constraints defined in `composer.json`. You can update specific dependencies only by listing them explicitly in the `composer update` commands. 

For example, to update Drupal core you would use `composer update drupal/core --with-dependencies`. If `composer.json` had the version constraint for `drupal/core` at `^8` then Composer will update Drupal core to the latest version of `8` but not update to `9.x`. You can read more about version constraints in the [version constraints documentation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/versions.md#caret-version-range-). `--with-dependencies` is necessary when explicitly updating Drupal core in order to download all of Drupal core's dependencies, such as Symfony. 

Once the desired dependencies have been updated with Composer you will need to commit the new files to Pantheon.

#### Congratulations! You now have a Drupal 8 site on Pantheon that is managed by Composer.

P.S. the [Pantheon Power Users Community](https://pantheon.io/docs/power-users/) Slack instance _#composer-workflow_ channel or [Pantheon Office Hours](https://pantheon.io/developers/office-hours) are great places to ask questions and chat about Composer.
